    The W3C works based on values and a vision for the Web. Rather than a series of high-level ideas that can too easily
    be ignored, our values and vision are directly embedded in how we work, how we collaborate, and in the process we follow
    to produce Web standards. This document describes the foundations of this approach, the concrete, detailed, operational
    principles that we apply to standards, and how these can be changed over time.

  <section id="sotd">
    <p>
      This document is just a proposal from its author. Describing it as anything more established than just one person's
      idea is deceptive.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Foundations</h2>
    <p>
      The scope of the web covers all of humankind and its nature is massive, complex, and evolving. As a result, a simple
      declaration of high-level ideas is insufficient to guide its development. The W3C is not legitimate for distilling
      a small set of values that are universally relevant to all of humankind in its glorious diversity. We are, however,
      legitimate in convening the broadest possible web community, in supporting it through the in-depth discussion of
      complex technical details and their consequences, and in helping groups turn these discussions into decisions that
      can be implemented and that represent the best consensus of the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Building on top of this very specific legitimacy, our values and vision are embedded directly in how we work such that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        They are implementable in the sense that they can be directly and productively applied to the review of all web
        standards. In the same way that a feature in a standard that is not testable is just words in the wind, values that
        do not support the evaluation of standards as they are produced are just cheap declarations. Our values walk the talk:
        they are described in detailed documents, and those documents are used in the process of horizontal review which all
        web standards must pass through. Our horizontal review documents drive towards the vision of a better web and enforce
        consistent, concrete, and detailed values across the board.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are produced and owned by the web community. There is no select group tasked with framing a constitution for the
        web. Instead, the community openly gathers in open groups to contribute to the evolution of this or that aspect of our
        values and vision. The power to evolve the W3C's values and vision is pushed to the edges and delegated to those who
        take part in the relevant debates as much as possible. The rare exception is this document, which is produced jointly
        by all of the W3C's different governance bodies, written specifically to be as short and limited as possible, and is
        ratified by the entire W3C Membership.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are not static but rather are living values, in constant evolution. Neither the web nor the world are stable,
        static places and our understanding of digital technology is still evolving faster than most can keep up with. A
        static document, or one that only evolves every few years, would fall behind quickly. But because we have distributed
        the work and pushed the power to evolve our values to the community, we are collectively constantly iterating on
        our values and vision to refine and improve them.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This approach works better for a project as complex and ambitious as the web meant for a world as richly diverse as
      ours. Because our values are detailed, they are less subject to imagined agreement and easier for newcomers to
      grasp. Because they are concrete and have consequences in terms of what standards can ship, the entire community
      has skin in the game because they cannot be ignored. Because they are subject to extensive debate and consensus,
      they are the best that a community can produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      More precisely, our values and vision are grounded in three elementary principles:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>User Agency</dt>
      <dd>
        The web is an application of the Internet, and the Internet is for end users ([[!RFC8890]]). The web shifts power
        toward people and increases "<em>what each person is able to do and to be</em>" ([[!Creating-Capabilities]])
        not only individually but also through collective structures.
      </dd>
      <dt>Subsidiarity</dt>
      <dd>
        tk
      </dd>
      <dt>Implementability</dt>
      <dd>
        tk
      </dd>
    </dl>

  - the scope and nature of the web are such that a simple declaration of principles is insufficient
  - this is how we do vision when the whole world is the scope
  - foundations
    - RFC8890: collaborative computing in the pursuit of greater user agency, defined as capabilities, and include the collective aspects as Apolito+web community
    - subsidiarity: delegate to expert groups that do the work
    - implementability (HR must work)
  - change
    - changing existing principles: talk to the right groups
    - adding a new principle area: write it up in sufficient detail, get a group together to support consensus, and prove there is interest by having a working HR for it
  - principles
    - whatever maps to a11y, i18n, security, privacy
    - interoperability & coherent (this is the mandate of the TAG, include an issue that the TAG is doing too much)

    Technical decisions do not happen in a vacuum. The decisions we make in shaping technology have consequences well outside the purely technical realm and while the bulk of design choices that make up web standards may have been motivated by reasons that are essentially technical in nature, we regularly need to adjudicate and to drive outcomes by reference to more general and more foundational principles with a broader impact than technology alone. Making this principled framework explicit empowers us to reference it more effectively when it needs to be called upon as well as to criticise and improve it when it falls short of our expectations.
However, we should not mistake the W3C community for a group of philosophers and legal scholars. We would be poorly served by a set of principles that are too lofty, too abstract, or that require too much conceptual engineering to apply. This document is built on a simple tenet: the W3C’s vision and principles should be held to the same criteria as its standards. They should be precise and testable, they should be interoperable and independently implementable.
In concrete terms, our principles are embodied in what we do and don’t consider desirable in a web standard; rather than abstract ideals they are concrete goals and constraints that are implemented in the standards we set. Specifically, the beating heart of our principles is the horizontal review system. We reject the notion that a small centralised group could be granted the power to decide which principles support standards that belong to the whole web community. Instead, we rely on subsidiarity — the principle according to which central authority should only perform tasks which can’t be performed at a more local level — and delegate the responsibility for concrete principles to specific horizontal review groups.
What we expect from horizontal review groups is that they develop concrete principles for their area and the expertise to apply these principles across the whole of the web’s technical stack, in collaboration with their community. The web should be shaped by the cooperation of diverse voices with different life stories and deep but varied expertise; horizontal review groups are a direct and workable implementation of this view. The only task that needs to be performed by a more central authority is that of organising this cooperation.
Nothing is a web principle that isn’t managed in horizontal review, and then only if it is shown to apply across different standards. Changes to our principles are carried out as changes to horizontal review — a living process undergoing constant refinement.
In concrete terms, we need review groups for:
accessibility,
internationalisation,
privacy, and
security.
The TAG should be tasked with the coordination of these groups. It should gather the relevant documents and questionnaires into a single, convenient, unified view. Additionally, the TAG should not be in charge of architectural review as that represents too much work for a small elected body. Rather, it should convene an additional architecture review group staffed from the broader community. The TAG would maintain its remit in producing documents intended to cut across the web’s architecture.
When a new problem area is recognised, a new horizontal review group can be established by the Membership according to a joint recommendation of the TAG and AB. The bar for such a group must be high, notably it should only be established based on a draft document clearly detailing review principles, with multiple examples of specifications which it could have directly improved through review, and with strong evidence that there are enough people to work on reviews.
Review groups should be represented on FO Councils.
The AB’s role with respect to the W3C’s vision and principles should be:
To uphold RFC 8890.
To enforce subsidiarity.
To identify new problems that may warrant changes to the horizontal review structure.
